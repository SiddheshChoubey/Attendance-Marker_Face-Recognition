# üì∏ Smart Attendance System using Face Detection

### üë®‚Äçüíª A Software Engineering Mini Project

This project is a **Face Recognition-Based Attendance System** built using **OpenCV**, **Haar Cascade**, and the **face_recognition** library in Python. It captures live video from a webcam, detects and recognizes faces, and logs attendance automatically.

---

## üß∞ Libraries Used

- **NumPy**  
  Supports multi-dimensional arrays and a collection of mathematical functions to operate on them.

- **Pandas**  
  Powerful and easy-to-use data analysis and manipulation tool built on Python.

- **OpenCV**  
  Real-time computer vision library used for image processing and video capture.

- **Haar Cascade**  
  Machine learning-based object detection algorithm used for identifying faces in an image or video.

- **face_recognition**  
  Simplest and most powerful face recognition library for Python.

## üìå Notes

- Make sure your webcam is enabled.
- Images of known faces must be placed in the `known_faces/` directory, each image named after the person it represents.
- Attendance will be logged in `attendancelog.csv`.
